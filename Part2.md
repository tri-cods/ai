# AI Tutorial: Part 2

* Image generator demo
    * Shout out some ideas for us to test in [Midjourney](https://discord.com/channels/1096150521418621079/1096465518812205187)
* HTML generator
  * Make a basic HTML site with a CSS file about an area of your research
  * Example: Jane Austen
  * Try it yourself! 
  * Share examples
* Discussion
  * What about [data privacy](https://theconversation.com/chatgpt-is-a-data-privacy-nightmare-if-youve-ever-posted-online-you-ought-to-be-concerned-199283) and [surveillance](https://marcwatkins.substack.com/p/its-time-to-step-off-the-ai-panic?sd=pf)? FERPA? 
    * TLDR:  Students still hold the copyright to their work, and we need to be respectful of students’ data rights. Uploading student work to third-party websites always needs clear consent.
    * Citation recommendation 
      * [MLA](https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/)
      * [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt)

  * Where is the line between assisting or supporting the work and actually doing the work?
  * What OpenAI is good for and not good for
      * Good: summaries, re-writing in a different voice, generating ideas for titles, brainstorming
      * Bad: accuracy, generating citations, potential bias
      * Specifically for college professors: asking students to write a summary of an article to prove they read it may be obsolete (but that may not have been a great use of writing to begin with).  Assignments which require more thought and personal connections are still out of reach of AI (today!).  
   * The future of AI
      * Improvements haven't come linearly – not sure whether progress will plateau or increase rapidly
      * Experts (at least those without financial stakes in AI companies) often have significant concern about misuse and biases
      * A large increase in AI generated web pages could create a major disruption in Google's search business, which is what most of the Internet is organized around.
